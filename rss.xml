&lt;p&gt;Being conscious is quite &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt;, we are all awake after an eternity of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something which can help us frame our perplexing situation is the creation myth known as “Adam and Eve”. This story reaches a crescendo when Eve, tempted by lucifer himself, eats from the tree of knowledge. Prior to this Eve and Adam were safe in paradise; safe from the opera of being. This paradisiacal state has been lost and we all work feverishly in order to reclaim a piece of its perfection. This parable can help us track the journey of the small, fragile yet defiant creatures who stand conscious beneath an infinite and silent universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the emergent phenomena consciousness appeared our species lived in an unconscious glow, there was only the world of the externality; a world were we swam in the eternal pond of our instincts. This is when we as animals were whole and complete like every other animal on this spinning rock. This however did not last long for we bit from the cursed apple; we defied our “creator” and now are conscious. We entered into the world of symbols and abstractions, a world which was only meant previously for the gods, yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fall from celestial heights was put eloquently by poet John Milton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the point in time when we awoke as man not beast, this is were &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our trouble began.
Here we can postulate the following: Occasionally, pulsating lights of true self-consciousness, as we know it now, began to flash at us archaic beasts only to be pushed painfully back down; for direct exposure to such clear crystallising lights is blinding and nauseating. We rose out of the blissful, sub-terrain slumber that encapsulated us for quite some time — now we have come face to face with the glistening sun of existence; our consciousness chained within this decaying fleshy case.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the aphorism that one extracts from our shared story: We are alive, awake and conscious, forever striving to be something rather than nothing. Our species is never content with our being, unlike the other creatures on earth we work desperately to be not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; another biological organism. If we were to look to the domesticated house cat we see something which is already complete and fulfilling its destiny with each passing moment; we won an intellect, it won serenity, we cannot imagine that &lt;em&gt;peace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to buffer against our inherent inner void we created elaborate stories and myths to give importance to our place in the cosmos, to comfort our brothers and sisters. These stories painted us fleeting primates as the centre of the universe, our pre-scientific worldview could assert such triumphant proclamations as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are held in the image of perfection itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our being is one of cosmic splendour and importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fundamental essence.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As nice as that sounds this is not the world we live in currently. As us modern folk move up our chains of cognitive abstractions we hit the apex of thought when we conceptualise that someday our life will be sucked back into the nothingness we emerged from. To archaic man this mode of thought ends with a peaceful return to eternal beauty, as he moves up towards the apex of cognition he is greeted with the gentle reminder that his soul is immortal and god shall warmth him soon. Primal man could never predict that we would be left to view the cosmos &lt;em&gt;stripped&lt;/em&gt; of the sacred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So neither god or state can save us now, rather we must create and rediscover our own purpose from within; &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, one can still ask: what sick faith would allow an animal to know its dreaded destiny? If we are now to think of being in its fullest sense it requires the destruction of all illusions and repressions — true powers of self-referentiality result in harrowing, dizzying experiences; but what use is possessed in this activity? To not lie about your nature and your destiny, that is the affirmation of &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;. This however is a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the sun we are blinded down towards the dark unconscious realm; one which wraps around us like the depths of an bottomless ocean – tragically, our tale has cast our species as merely feeble divers with ebbing amounts of breath, if we do not plan our descent we will surely &lt;em&gt;drown&lt;/em&gt;.
So, it makes sense to first sketch a map of our terrain before we dive too deep into the underworld of being. This is what the metaphor formerly presented states: with our gods &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; existence demands a robust reformulation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the book of Genesis the authors could see the paradox of our species:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  “&lt;em&gt;the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked&lt;/em&gt;;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at once awoke to our nature while standing naked before the cosmos, this is the true paradox of being. To be self-aware but nude, vulnerable but weak; one can imagine these early primates to use their advanced cognitive abilities to ask the blatant questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1).&lt;/strong&gt; Who has left us here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2).&lt;/strong&gt; Why us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the book of Genesis we disobeyed our creator and now must face our existence alone, each man, woman and child &lt;em&gt;witness&lt;/em&gt; to the horrors of being. Yet, that is just one way to frame our situation, alternatively we could kiss the same truth from the lips of the fallen gods and still, in spite of the futility, strive for totality. That would be something truly virtuous. Who then will we be when the night looks down on our mortal flesh and no judgement reigns from the blessed isles, will we still act as towers of divinity who rise purposefully above the dirt we will all soon rot beneath? Our time is  limited as a species, eternities passed without us and someday the universe will rest peacefully without us stridently tugging on its matter. If we remain honest about being then we can possess some humility in the face of our predicament, that could be true atonement with &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made sense in the past to distort our species most fatal axiom: regardless of your actions there is simply no way to prevent the annihilation of your psyche. Your dynamic patterns of neuronal connections will soon be dust and dirt. Fair enough, before we were scared and confused — we could not yet bear such a shattering truth. Now however, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; can step forward with this truth in hand and man alone can decide his own purpose, this could justify any &lt;em&gt;destruction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We once asked the question with fear in our hearts: &lt;em&gt;who will be the arbiter of this twisted fate?&lt;/em&gt; The gods remained silent so now it seems right that we alone step forth. Our eyes can witness the flickering stars, the glimmering ocean and the scintillating moon; in the middle of an incomprehensible infinity we can see these almost divine images all around us, this provides us proof that &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; has worth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can find truth in the poetic words of Blaise Pascal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;em&gt;“Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed. But even if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than his slayer, because he knows that he is dying and the advantage the universe has over him. The universe knows none of this.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, It seems to acquire such meaning in this life we must awake to our nature; this rather than to forever be falling, to forever be asleep. As the saying goes, we are the children of chance and misery, this does not negate &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; rather rejuvenates it; for we alone know our faith and can act in accordance to it, that is &lt;strong&gt;courage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TheEmbrace]]></title><description><![CDATA[A dialogue between Man and his Soul  S: Who has dared to enter the desert for which I am.

&lt;p&gt;S: Who has dared to enter the desert for which I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: I have, I wish to understand why you ask so much from me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S: Are you a fool or child?
Have you allowed yourself to be stripped and eaten by my vultures of God?
Have you given up earthy reigns in order to attain entry to the blessed isles?
Or, have you acted as the pathetic fool I know you are, one which rots at its core, one which satiates desire after desire, one which lets others frock on your soul. Even with all of this.. you still you assert some worth despite your hollow, twisted core?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: I am willingly to destroy myself, I can let it all dissolve - but will that be enough, what lies beneath this apparition, what will I experience if I fall to the depths of being, my heart and intellect tremble of such a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S: If you wish to dance to the songs of the dead you must first relinquish the grasp of being for you alone are not equipped to hold it. The sun of judgement beads on your tiny heart thus will burn it alive, does that sound admirable, does that sound enjoyable, or does it sound absolutely necessary.
You stand now at the gates of being, to enter you must set a blaze all previous gods for they are heavy and weak and shall not float in these depths, do you accept my command?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: I accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S: Then let us begin, take my hand and I shall guide you, the blind man, through the lowest levels of the soul, here you will become eternal and nocturnal all at once, for here is where your ancestors have danced and cried, you too will learn to dance to the poorest tunes, do you understand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S: Let us go and let us reclaim you who are, rather who you are meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TheEmbrace]]></title><description><![CDATA[  The Embrace

&lt;strong&gt;Dramatis Personæ&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;strong&gt;Nietzsche&lt;/strong&gt;:  Overcoming
&lt;strong&gt;Schopenhauer&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We find two of our philosophically minded friends by the seaside during the darkness of night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZCHE: Verily, it seems we have encountered under the stars and moonlight; coincidence or not Schopenhauer I demand another glimpse of your tongue, for these matters of life scream for examination!
SCHOPENHAUER: Please leave me alone, YOU festering creep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZCHE: Thunderous, spiteful proclamations cannot will this conversation back towards the abyss my friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: If I speak with you and your &lt;em&gt;ridiculous&lt;/em&gt; mus-tache will you make this charade end quick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZCHE: Aha! I knew you would follow me to the heights my friend, here we can discuss what strikes man as the most powerful of ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: Fine. You have defiantly interrupted my precious &lt;em&gt;silence&lt;/em&gt;, all for your mindless noise.. what do you wish to speak upon? Well?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZCHE: I have read your most recent and brooding of works, you assert the futility of our existence. Do you see no way out? Do you wish to destroy the horizon like the madman warned when he proclaimed of the gods demise? Is this what you want? Ask yourself this, can man alone act as the captain of a vessel through the plains of infinite nothingness? My spirit believes so; the blood still runs through our hearts friend thus we mustn’t surrender to the calls of the abyss! The image of our creators heart was punctured with a divine sword, he has bled too much thus we stand here naked under the stars covered in his blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You however, your writings send a crashing wave through my very soul, this destabilisation is enough to wake the mountains of Vesuvius and burn a generation of laughter alive. I can recover from this for I can handle such a feat my friend, but I worry you are wishing to rip the sun from earth without any hope of revitalising the soil! There is however a way for man to ascend out from this wretched pit of &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: Hah, your fear is masked by your passion Nietzsche. My works speak of the truth which our species begs to distort. For what is &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;?  I will tell you, the compound of fleeting desires, misguided passions and numbing vanity; this is why I reject fools like you who share my air, you, the great fool, Friedrich Nietzsche, the man who’s corpus inspired some of the greatest catastrophes our planet has ever witnessed, yet you demand for my explanations? Does your spirit not allure you to the folly of your own existence? You created hell ten times over and demand for my reconsideration? I at least have the courage to state the world in its boldest, truest form!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: ENOUGH! ENOUGH I SAY. My debt has not yet been paid to mankind, therefore I furiously work now to undo what has been done in my spirit! I wrote in blood and died in blood; my words were uttered by the rabble of man not by the Free Spirits. You know my dear Zarathustra wished for nothing but the heights, he wished to laugh upon the depths and untie the knot around mans neck! A will of that kind can relinquish the noose around any a species neck my dear friend, even man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: You are a fool. You died a mad fool. You will &lt;em&gt;remain&lt;/em&gt; a fool. You share much of traits of the madman you proclaim in jest, for little did his fear know the death of god was no loss; rather an awakening to what this world is in its purest state.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: I do not refute our lot, I embrace it and transform, a series of metamorphic emergences. Who among my peers have ever wished to help man before me? Rather, they wished to keep their&lt;br&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;truths&lt;/em&gt;” immutable for personal gain, I believe your work speaks more of you than of your “&lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;”, one which rots your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: If my truth rots me then so be it, I prefer honesty over charlatans. You, the blubbering madman, you remind me of the lamb in the field, who dances and cheers unknowingly awaiting the butchers blade, you like all men also dance and cheer, you laugh from the heights, but the butcher will strike against your throat with his knife; can you not deny that is the fate of man? Surely the blubbering creep will acknowledge the abyss does not rest under us; rather we lie in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: Verily, you have confused my path for one of joy and tulips; rather my path is filled with roses, in the sense of their &lt;em&gt;thorns&lt;/em&gt;, you see my friend nothing is worth true beauty without the stab of a prick! AHA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: For heavens sake..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: Hah! Now, your apathy bleeds me dry friend, listen before I faint with the boredom you speak so much of, for I have a story to tell you. There once lived a man who’s birth coincided with the death of a galaxy; he lived upon a glimmering rock in the cosmic swing of the universe, here, he wished to inject a frenzy into man, one which propels man to the peak and overcomes the depths. Thus, Upon this rock, which rested itself above the starved, chattering abyss, this man decided that he would relinquish the collection of jewels he collected in his youth back unto the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: Yes, yes fascinating. Man, rock, jewels, dynamite stuff you fool. I am bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: Everything bores you, I am yet to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: Ah what a pity, I on the other hand am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ominous man approaches from the dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAMUS: Hello Gentleman, what a lovely night we have under the endless sky, Oh, to explore the universe like the fallen raindrop which explores a lonely leaf, that would surely fill ones heart with love and joy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: This man speaks of lonely leafs yet I am the fool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: BE GONE FROM THIS WORLD CAMUS, YOU ARE THE WORST THING THIS ROCK HAS PUKED THUS FAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAMUS: hah, my &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt;, I always enjoy a good ribbing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: So be it, you shall receive one song of the heart before I go; let this speak my meaning onto you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;The Fallen Citadel   

Oh here I kneel again within the void,
Many suns used to dance around this icy space,
For who can now cast their eyes to the brightest smiles?
For who can see in this darkest place?
For who can still taste the blissful warmth of light?
For who will speak of highest peaks in such a pit?
For Now the children weep while the cold bites at souls,
For I see poison which gnaws at the hearts of many sheep,
For this I ask, who can wrap blankets upon piercing souls?  
Does infirmity compel our spirit to these depths?
Perhaps I will light all thus forth? Verily, I summon light amongst the rot,
Man will emerge anew, conquerer and adorer of his fate,
We must make pace for times pointed teeth begs for the throats of men and women,
So say this forth,
I alone spark light in the coldest gulf,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I alone scorch divine embers in bottomless depths,
I alone burn the hearts of gods and drink from the wine of the sun,
For now I rest in the blessed isles with gifts for man who’s wish is warmth,
So now I call out, embrace ones luck before you refute ones lot!
And this is my song&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: That was badly timed and full of contradictions. Did you write that as a child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something dawned upon me while you spoke. I began to think, these &lt;em&gt;nebulous&lt;/em&gt; words you splutter, do they not act as merely the blanket for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; trembling soul, not for the soul of man. Do you think they can protect you from what your spirit knows to be true?
Think on that before you dare speak to me of “&lt;em&gt;bottomless depths&lt;/em&gt;”. I am leaving and hope to not experience your presence once more. I also question any &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; who recites poetry during the darkness of night…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAMUS: WAIT, wait, this song strikes my heart as eternal beauty, do you not see the truth in his words? This man wishes to lick the moon and kiss the sun during our earthly reign; this is something I can appreciate! I do not know you well friend, But you have an ear who begs to hear more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCHOPENHAUER: No, no. &lt;em&gt;Enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIETZSCHE: Perhaps another time my new friend, for now I grow weary and must rest.
Goodbye and let my words rest easy on any soul who wishes for nourishing light amongst the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The three spirits part ways with a frenzy of ideas chattering within each man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The End&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
