Eve and Adam are safe in paradise; safe from the opera of being. This story is most pertinent when conceptualising our road to this dizzying self-consciousness. Before the manifesting property sentience arose we lived in an unconscious glow, there was only the world of the externality; a world were we swam in the eternal pond of our instincts. This is when we as animals were whole + complete like every other animal we shared this world with.</p>\n<p>At some unknown point in time we awoke as man not beast, this is were <em>all</em> our trouble begun.\nWe can almost postulate the following: Occasionally, pulsating lights of true self-consciousness, as we know it now, began to flash at us archaic beasts only to be pushed painfully back down; for direct exposure to such clear crystallising lights is blinding and nauseating. We rose out of the blissful, sub-terrain slumber that encapsulated us for quite some time – now we have come face to face with the glistening sun of existence.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4380a46c075ea95997ff64cb87f39bb6/49927/urizen.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 154.57142857142858%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"wow\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4380a46c075ea95997ff64cb87f39bb6/f8fb9/urizen.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4380a46c075ea95997ff64cb87f39bb6/e8976/urizen.jpg 148w,\n/static/4380a46c075ea95997ff64cb87f39bb6/63df2/urizen.jpg 295w,\n/static/4380a46c075ea95997ff64cb87f39bb6/f8fb9/urizen.jpg 590w,\n/static/4380a46c075ea95997ff64cb87f39bb6/49927/urizen.jpg 700w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Sadly, this is the deafening aphorism that one extracts from our shared story. The land of abstractions and symbolism have become as real as the physical reality we exist within. We are alive, awake and conscious. Here lies the issue, we as a species are never content with our being, unlike the other mammals on earth, we must always strive to be complete where the domesticated cat is already complete, it is already whole and fulfilling its destiny with each passing moment; we cannot imagine that serenity. In order to buffer against being we created elaborate stories and myths to understand our place in the cosmos and to comfort our brothers and sisters.</p>\n<p> These stories painted us primates as the centre of the universe, our pre-scientific worldview could assert such triumphant proclamations as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are held in the image of something which is perfect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our being is one of cosmic splendour and importance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have a fundamental essence.   </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, This is not the world we live in currently. As us modern folk move up our chains of cognitive abstractions we hit the apex of thought when we conceptualise that someday our life will be sucked back into the dark abyss. To archaic man this mode of thought ends with a peaceful return to eternal beauty, as he moves up towards the apex of cognition he is greeted with the gentle reminder that his soul is immortal and god shall warmth him soon. Archaic man could never predict that we would be left to view the cosmos stripped of the sacred - now I do not know about you, but black abyss sounds far less desirable than immortal soul filled with eternal beauty.</p>\n<p>So neither god or man can save us now rather we must create our own splendour; <em>fantastic</em>.</p>\n<p>We can now ask: what sick joker would allow an animal to know its dreaded destiny? If we are now to think of being in its fullest sense it requires the destruction of all illusions and repressions – true powers of self-referentiality result in harrowing, dizzying experiences; but what use is possessed in this activity? The use is what Carl Jung denoted as the <strong>self</strong>, something which is whole and complete, the totality of your being in every sense of the word. To not lie about your nature and your destiny, that is being in its purest sense.</p>\n<p>When we look at the sun we are cast down towards the dark unconscious realm; one which wraps around us like the depths of an bottomless ocean – tragically, our tale consists of us as merely feeble divers with ebbing amounts of breath, if we do not plan our descent we will surely drown.\nSo, let us first sketch a map of our terrain before we dive too deep into the underworld of being. This is what the metaphor formerly presented states: Existence <em>now</em> demands a robust formulation.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8e9443f2dce5a4c223599c40dfaa8c56/bf27b/blake_w.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 131.07511045655374%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Forever Falling\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8e9443f2dce5a4c223599c40dfaa8c56/f8fb9/blake_w.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8e9443f2dce5a4c223599c40dfaa8c56/e8976/blake_w.jpg 148w,\n/static/8e9443f2dce5a4c223599c40dfaa8c56/63df2/blake_w.jpg 295w,\n/static/8e9443f2dce5a4c223599c40dfaa8c56/f8fb9/blake_w.jpg 590w,\n/static/8e9443f2dce5a4c223599c40dfaa8c56/bf27b/blake_w.jpg 679w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>“<em>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked</em>;”</p>\n<p>Ah, the fateful last words of mankind. We at once awoke to our nature while standing naked before the cosmos, this is the true paradox of being. To be self-aware but nude, vulnerable but weak; one can imagine our ancestors to ask: Who has left us here? Who has done this to us? We disobeyed our creator and now must face our existence alone, witnesses  to the horrors of being.</p>\n<p>The pity is the axiom our species distorts: It doesn’t matter what you do, there is simply no way to prevent the annihilation of your psyche. Your dynamic pattern of neuronal connections will soon be dust and dirt. Excellent, so who will be the arbiter of this twisted fate? The gods cannot since they remain silent, so man alone must decide his will forward. What can we do to possible justify this wretchedness?</p>\n<p>Can we kiss the truth from the lips of god and still strive for totality? That would be something truly virtuous. Who will we be when the night looks down on our mortal flesh and no man nor woman casts judging eyes upon us? Will we act as towers of divinity which rises above the dirt we will all soon rot beneath?</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/0ebec/ciano.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 123.61940298507463%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"william\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/f8fb9/ciano.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/e8976/ciano.jpg 148w,\n/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/63df2/ciano.jpg 295w,\n/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/f8fb9/ciano.jpg 590w,\n/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/85e3d/ciano.jpg 885w,\n/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/d1924/ciano.jpg 1180w,\n/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/9452e/ciano.jpg 1770w,\n/static/d05fb0b99d39051b232c7de6551c9a16/0ebec/ciano.jpg 2680w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><em>“Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed.
