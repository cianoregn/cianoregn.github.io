Eve and Adam are safe in paradise; safe from the opera of being. This story is most pertinent when conceptualising our road to this dizzying self-consciousness. Before the manifesting property sentience arose we lived in an unconscious glow, there was only the world of the externality; a world were we swam in the eternal pond of our instincts. Thus we can begin to postulate the following: Occasionally, pulsating lights of true consciousness, as we know it now , began to flash at us archaic beasts, only to be pushed painfully back down; for direct exposure to such clear crystallising lights is blinding and nauseating. We rose out of the blissful, sub-terrain slumber that encapsulated us for quite some time - now we have come face to face with the glistening sun of existence.</p>\n<p>Alas, this is the deafening aphorism that one extracts from this story. The land of abstractions and symbolism have become as real as the physical reality we exist within. <em>Why?</em></p>\n<p>When thinking of our species one must first contend with following axiom: our collective phenomenological experience is as real as anything else in this universe. The matter contained in your cranium which has fused, connected and allowed this emergent phenomena should be taken seriously; consciousness cannot be discarded as a trivial byproduct nature mistakenly generated. To think of being however requires self-sacrifice, true powers of self-referentiality result in harrowing, dizzying experiences.</p>\n<p>This is why we look at the sun to be cast back towards the dark unconscious realm; one which wraps around us like the depths of the ocean, yet, in this tale we are merely feeble divers with ebbing amounts of breath. Verily, we must first sketch a map of our terrain before we dive too deep into the underworld. This is what the parable formerly presented states: Existence <strong>demands</strong> evaluation.</p>\n<p>“<em>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked</em>;”</p>\n<p><img src=\"./blake_w.jpeg\" alt=\"Foreverfalling\"></p>\n<p>Ah, the fateful last words of mankind. We at once awoke to our nature while standing naked before the cosmos, this is the true paradox of being.
