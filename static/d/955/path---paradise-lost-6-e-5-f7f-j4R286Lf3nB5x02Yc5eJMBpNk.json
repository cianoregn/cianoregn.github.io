We are all awake after an eternity of sleep.</p>\n<p>A story which can help us frame our perplexing situation is the creation myth known as “Adam and Eve”. The penultimate point in this cataclysmic parable is when Eve, tempted by the twisted snake, bravely eats from the tree of knowledge. Eve and Adam are safe in paradise; safe from the opera of being. This story is most pertinent when conceptualising the journey of us small, fragile yet defiant creatures who stand self-conscious within an infinite universe.</p>\n<p>Before the manifesting phenomena sentience arose we all lived in an unconscious glow, there was only the world of the externality; a world were we swam in the eternal pond of our instincts. This is when we as animals were whole and complete like every other animal on this spinning rock. This however did not last long for we bit from the cursed apple; we defied our “creator” and now are conscious. We entered into the world of symbols and abstractions, a world which was only meant previously for the gods, yet here we are.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e7857bf5fb3a5d9f2b4787f0f2bffd92/a0e60/adam.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 147.125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAdABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHPJ9A4SIzopJZtBhP/xAAcEAACAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADERIhIjH/2gAIAQEAAQUCqoFnNgygUXyYWwHgbZfiaMWFRP/EABgRAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQERIh/9oACAEDAQE/Aa4Q/wD/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASIP/aAAgBAgEBPwFR/8QAHxAAAQMFAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARYQIQEiExAzJR/9oACAEBAAY/ApK9TK2EMttxVuB1rZQvJT8L24yM2//EAB4QAAICAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQRBRYZGh/9oACAEBAAE/IVpTqAc2lApTiKRTDAIlNqCbkwfiRpxr5AkUIjBdYhQNYhLEKXUICo843v3P/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBA+U3/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAH/2gAIAQMBAT8QzOphMbf/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEQ/9oACAECAQE/EFDbzS//xAAhEAEAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRYXGBkaHh8P/aAAgBAQABPxA5ksFRfqIaQt+Ju3cGWLIlaQbxtxkLr8SrUpDZnR9BPaZHesQFCURNVtHlzLHWLDBF+7jQEOkECSE7q5iApcFeaW0gt2+Y/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"adam\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e7857bf5fb3a5d9f2b4787f0f2bffd92/f8fb9/adam.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e7857bf5fb3a5d9f2b4787f0f2bffd92/e8976/adam.jpg 148w,\n/static/e7857bf5fb3a5d9f2b4787f0f2bffd92/63df2/adam.jpg 295w,\n/static/e7857bf5fb3a5d9f2b4787f0f2bffd92/f8fb9/adam.jpg 590w,\n/static/e7857bf5fb3a5d9f2b4787f0f2bffd92/a0e60/adam.jpg 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>As put by John Milton:</p>\n<p><em>“Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit\nOf that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast\nBrought Death into the World, and all our woe,\nWith loss of Eden, till one greater Man\nRestore us, and regain the blissful Seat”</em></p>\n<p>This was the point in time when we awoke as man not beast, this is were <em>all</em> our trouble began.\nWe can almost postulate the following: Occasionally, pulsating lights of true self-consciousness, as we know it now, began to flash at us archaic beasts only to be pushed painfully back down; for direct exposure to such clear crystallising lights is blinding and nauseating.

Our species is never content with our being, unlike the other creatures on earth we work desperately to be not <em>just</em> another biological organism. If we were to look to the domesticated house cat we see something which is already complete and fulfilling its destiny with each passing moment; we cannot imagine that <em>peace</em>. In order to buffer against our inherent inner void we created elaborate stories and myths to give importance to our place in the cosmos, to comfort our brothers and sisters.</p>\n<p> These stories painted us fleeting primates as the centre of the universe, our pre-scientific worldview could assert such triumphant proclamations as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are held in the image of perfection itself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our being is one of cosmic splendour and importance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have a fundamental essence.   </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As nice as that sounds this is not the world we live in currently. As us modern folk move up our chains of cognitive abstractions we hit the apex of thought when we conceptualise that someday our life will be sucked back into the nothingness we emerged from. To archaic man this mode of thought ends with a peaceful return to eternal beauty, as he moves up towards the apex of cognition he is greeted with the gentle reminder that his soul is immortal and god shall warmth him soon. Primal man could never predict that we would be left to view the cosmos <em>stripped</em> of the sacred.</p>\n<p>So neither god or state can save us now, rather we must create and rediscover our own purpose from within; <em>fantastic</em>.</p>\n<p>But, one can still ask: what sick faith would allow an animal to know its dreaded destiny? If we are now to think of being in its fullest sense it requires the destruction of all illusions and repressions – true powers of self-referentiality result in harrowing, dizzying experiences; but what use is possessed in this activity? The use is what Carl Jung denoted as the <strong>self</strong>, something which is whole and complete, the totality of your being in every sense of the word. To not lie about your nature and your destiny, that is being in its purest sense.</p>\n<p>When we look at the sun we are blinded down towards the dark unconscious realm; one which wraps around us like the depths of an bottomless ocean – tragically, our tale has cast our species as merely feeble divers with ebbing amounts of breath, if we do not plan our descent we will surely <em>drown</em>.\nSo, it makes sense to first sketch a map of our terrain before we dive too deep into the underworld of being. This is what the metaphor formerly presented states: with our gods <em>dead</em> existence demands a robust reformulation.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/c1266/mett2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Forever Falling\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/f8fb9/mett2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/e8976/mett2.jpg 148w,\n/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/63df2/mett2.jpg 295w,\n/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/f8fb9/mett2.jpg 590w,\n/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/85e3d/mett2.jpg 885w,\n/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/d1924/mett2.jpg 1180w,\n/static/f60938292913a5a1735f7167c2d3c3d4/c1266/mett2.jpg 1200w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Even in the book of Genesis the authors could see the paradox in our species:  </p>\n<p>  “<em>the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked</em>;”</p>\n<p>We at once awoke to our nature while standing naked before the cosmos, this is the true paradox of being. To be self-aware but nude, vulnerable but weak; one can imagine these early primates to use their advanced cognitive abilities to ask the blatant questions: Who has left us here? Who has done this to us? According to the book of Genesis we disobeyed our creator and now must face our existence alone, each man, woman and child <em>witness</em> to the horrors of being. Yet, that is just one way to frame our situation, alternatively we could kiss the truth from the lips of the fallen gods and still, in spite of the futility, strive for totality. That would be something truly virtuous. Our eyes can witness the flickering stars, the glimmering ocean and the smiling moon; in the middle of an incomprehensible infinity we can see these almost divine images all around us, that alone makes us lucky.</p>\n<p>If we grant that luck who then will we be when the night looks down on our mortal flesh and no judgement reigns from the blessed isles? Will we still act as towers of divinity who rise purposefully above the dirt we will all soon rot beneath? Our time is clearly limited as a species, eternities passed without us and someday the universe will rest peacefully without us stridently tugging on its matter. If we remain honest about being then we can possess some humility in the face of our predicament, that could be true atonement with <em>life</em>.</p>\n<p>It made sense in the past to distort our species most fatal axiom: regardless of your actions there is simply no way to prevent the annihilation of your psyche. Your dynamic patterns of neuronal connections will soon be dust and dirt. Fair enough, before we were scared and confused, we asked the question with fear in our hearts: who will be the arbiter of this twisted fate? The gods cannot since they remain silent.  Now however we can be brave and man alone can decide his will forward, to justify this <em>destruction</em>.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/8c4f9/RENE.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.9249146757679%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Beauty\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/f8fb9/RENE.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/e8976/RENE.jpg 148w,\n/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/63df2/RENE.jpg 295w,\n/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/f8fb9/RENE.jpg 590w,\n/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/85e3d/RENE.jpg 885w,\n/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/d1924/RENE.jpg 1180w,\n/static/a774d00467dbd769e64cc145a498d16c/8c4f9/RENE.jpg 1465w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>To conclude with the poetic words of Blaise Pascal:</p>\n<p>  <em>“Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed.

As the saying goes, we are the children of chance and suffering, this does not negate <em>being</em> rather rejuvenates it; for we alone know our faith and can act in accordance to it, that is <strong>courage</strong>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Paradise Lost","date":"February 02, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Paradise-Lost/","previous":null,"next":null}}
